NAME
    ExtUtils::BundleMaker - Supports making bundles of modules recursively

SYNOPSIS
        use ExtUtils::BundleMaker;

        my $eu_bm = ExtUtils::BundleMaker->new(
            modules => [ 'Important::One', 'Mandatory::Dependency' ],
            # down to which perl version core modules shall be included?
            recurse => 'v5.10',
            target => 'inc/bundle.inc',
        );
        # create bundle
        $eu_bm->make_bundle();

DESCRIPTION
    ExtUtils::BundleMaker is designed to support authors automatically
    create a bundle of important prerequisites which aren't needed outside
    of the distribution but might interfere or overload target.

    Because of no dependencies are recorded within a distribution, entire
    distributions of recorded dependencies are bundled.
